# What you have to build

A web app allowing the user to search GitHub repositories, using the GitHub search API.
This will form the basis for a technical discussion around your chosen approach.

## How to run my App

- Click the green Clone or Download button and copy the link

- Go into your terminal and in whatever folder you choose, run git clone (the clone link)

- CD into the Soar_Tech_Challenge folder

- run npm install

- run npm start

- The app should open in your browser, from there type whatever you want to search in the input and click submit

- The app should now show results for the keyword you searched

## What I would have worked on next 

- I would possibly change the layout of how the search results are returned. I used an Unordered List initially working through the app and stuck with it, but I did start looking into react Tables. The data might have been better in tabular form, but I had to decide if the time spent on changing that would really improve it that much. 

- With more time I would implement a sort function. Reading into a few of the react-table's that are avaiable I think they have built in sorting features, but apart from them I would build a function myself. I think I would use 2 drop down menu's, 1. for what to sort the results by (i.e Stars, Forks) and then 2. ascending/descending. I would call the function with a sort button.
