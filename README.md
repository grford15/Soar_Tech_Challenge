# What you have to build

A web app allowing the user to search GitHub repositories, using the GitHub search API.
This will form the basis for a technical discussion around your chosen approach.

## How should you build it

Feel free to spend as little or as much time as you like, however we would advise not
spending more than 2-3 hours. You do not have to complete the entire exercise. Use
whatever web technology, framework, packages, build system and libraries that you feel
comfortable with to build it. Extra brownie points will be given if you can build the
solution in our tech stack - but it’s not essential!
Use the GitHub search API to obtain the required results. Use your imagination to figure
out how best to utilise the API and display & sort the results, e.g. sort by stars/forks,
paging, infinite scrolling or whatever other features you want.
Please ensure that there are no globally installed dependencies required to build/run your
app. If you have to have them please explain why. This avoids environment issues when
we are trying to build your solution.

## Some tips:

• Use this as an opportunity to demonstrate your technical knowledge and
  engineering skills.

• We hope to see a usable UI and clear code, demonstrating good, modern
  engineering practices.

• You decide how to split your time on the various engineering tasks that would be
  needed for such a web app. For example, you may decide to spend more time on
  creating a sleek UI or you may prefer to demonstrate your solid testing skills.

• Remember to provide appropriate documentation on: How to build, test and run
  your submission; Anything you would have liked to implement with more time,
  pending issues; Anything else you feel is worth mentioning.

Please submit your code to your own personal GitHub repository and reply to the
email that contained this challenge with a link to the repository by the agreed completion date.
